/**
 * 
 * Implement the authentication_provider.dart:
 * 
 *  provider will act as a bridge between the UI
 * and the authentication_service.dart.
 * 
 *  It should expose methods for user registration, 
 * user login, user logout, and accessing the current user's authentication state.
 * 
 * The provider can make use of the ChangeNotifier or ChangeNotifierProvider 
 * from the provider package to manage the authentication state and 
 * notify the listeners when the state changes.
 * 
 *  Inside the provider, you can initialize an instance of the 
 * authentication_service.dart and call the appropriate 
 * methods based on the actions triggered by the UI.
